## Visual Design - Emoji Mapping
### Robots (per player)
- Player 1: 🤖
- Player 2: 🦾
- Player 3: ⚙️
- Player 4: 🔩

### Environment
- Empty space: ⬜ or ⬛ (alternating for grid pattern)
- Obstacle: 🧱
- Mine: 💣
- Explosion: 💥
- Invisible robot: 🌫️

### UI Elements
- Energy: ⚡
- Target/Attack: 🎯
- Program loop indicator: 🔄
- Direction arrows: ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️↖️↗️↙️↘️ (8 directions: N/S/E/W/NE/NW/SE/SW)

## Movement System
- **8-directional movement** as per original:
  - N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
  - DM (Directed Move) supports all 8 directions
  - RM (Random Move) picks from all 8 directions
  - PS (Pursue) and FT (Flee) use 8-directional pathfinding

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Engine 🔧
1. **Robot Class** - energy, position, program storage, execution
2. **Arena Class** - grid management, obstacle/mine placement, 8-directional movement
3. **Instructions** - all 9 instruction types with energy costs
4. **Game State** - turn management, win conditions

### Phase 2: Basic Display 🎨
1. **Console Display** - emoji-based arena visualization
2. **Robot Status** - energy, position, current instruction
3. **Turn Counter** - current turn, actions per turn display

### Phase 3: Programming Interface 💻
1. **Menu System** - game setup (players, energy, obstacles, etc.)
2. **Program Input** - instruction selection per robot, 8-direction selection for DM
3. **Program Validation** - check instruction limits, energy costs

### Phase 4: Battle System ⚔️
1. **Turn Execution** - simultaneous robot action processing
2. **Collision Resolution** - movement conflicts, attacks, 8-directional movement
3. **Win Detection** - last robot standing, energy-based tiebreaker

### Phase 5: AI Opponents 🧠
1. **Default Programs** - from original magazine (Horace Alpha, etc.)
2. **AI Selection** - fill missing human players with AI
3. **Difficulty Variants** - different AI strategies

### Phase 6: Quality of Life ✨
1. **Save/Load Programs** - JSON-based robot program storage
2. **Battle Replays** - step-through previous battles
3. **Animation Speed** - configurable turn delay
4. **Enhanced Stats** - damage dealt, moves made, etc.

## Key Design Principles

### Modularity
- Core game logic independent of UI
- Easy to swap display systems (terminal → web → GUI)
- Pluggable AI system for new opponents

### Extensibility
- New instructions easy to add
- Arena size configurable
- Additional game modes possible (team battles, tournaments)

### Faithfulness
- All original instructions preserved with 8-directional movement
- Energy costs match original specs
- Turn-based simultaneous execution as intended

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each instruction type
- Integration tests for battle scenarios including 8-directional movement
- AI vs AI automated testing for balance
- Manual testing for UI/UX flows

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Web interface (Flask/FastAPI + HTML5)
- Network multiplayer
- Tournament mode with brackets
- Visual battle animations
- Sound effects
- Advanced AI with machine learning
- Arena editor for custom maps
- Scripting language for more complex programs

## Getting Started
1. Create project structure
2. Implement Robot and Arena classes with 8-directional support
3. Add basic instruction set
4. Create simple display system
5. Build minimal game loop
6. Test with manual robot programs
7. Add default AI opponents
8. Polish UI and add features
